This project aims to explore the Road accident data to understand accident trends of different factors such as area,vehical type,road type,day light - night light, casualties takes place after accident,monthly trend with rspect to years. The aims is to study how can strategies can be improved and optimized to avoid road accidents.

Analysis List-
1. Accident Severity - Perform data anaysis on accident severity with respect to number of casualties takes place for each severity such as Fatal, Serious and Slight
  to get insights.
2. Vehical type - Perform analysis vehical type based on number of casualties take place. Group them in such way that data analysis would be more understandble.
3. Yearly Anaysis - Year wise analysis done with respect to month on the bases of casualties for the year 2021 and 2022.
4. Road Type - In this first we analys the road type such as Dual carriage way,Single carrige way, One way street,Roundabout and slip Road and Secondly on road surace type 
  weather the surface type is Dry, wet or snowly so that get insights.

Data Wrangling - First step was to make sure there are no Blanks in primary table ie in accident index. There are no Typos,Date is in proper formate and missing values are
deteted and Clean the data.
Added New columns- Month and Year - Using text function.
Added Filters - Added Filters for Year and Area.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - EDA done for following resquirements

1. Primary KPI - Total casualties take place after the aciident
2. Primary KPI's - Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximus casualties by type od vehical.
3. Secondary KPI - Total casualties based on Road type
4. Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for 2021 nd 2022 year.
5. Maximum Casualties by road type.
6. Distribution of total casualties by road surface.
7. Relation between casualties by area and light or Dark.
